# Hero Video Setup

After generating the motion video in Kling AI, place the file here:

```
public/hero-motion.mp4
```

The video will automatically play on scroll on the landing page hero section.
If no video is present, the logo watermark fallback will be shown.

Optionally, export a poster frame (first frame as JPEG):
```
public/hero-poster.jpg
```
